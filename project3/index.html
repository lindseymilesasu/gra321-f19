            INGREDIENTS
                                        
            <li>1 cup salted butter softened</li>
            <li>1 cup white (granulated) sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup light brown sugar packed</li>
            <li>2 tsp pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>½ tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp sea salt</li>
            <li>2 cups chocolate chips(or chunks, or chopped chocolate)</p>
    
    <p>Put wet and dry ingredients into two different bowls. Once they are both mixed combine the bowls. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (if you are baking the frozen dough) and put the cookies in the oven in the beginning of the preheating time. Set the timer for 15 minutes and remove the cookies after 15 minutes. The top will look a little more brown than usual, but they will still taste amazing.</p>
